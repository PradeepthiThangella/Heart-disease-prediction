## Introduction

The Heart Disease Prediction project aims to create a user-friendly web application that allows users to input relevant medical information and receive a prediction for the likelihood of having heart disease. The machine learning model, trained on a heart disease-specific dataset, provides accurate predictions.

## Features

The Heart Disease Prediction web application offers the following features:

- **User Input**: Users can input their medical information, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors.
- **Disease Prediction**: The application utilizes a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of having heart disease based on the inputted medical data.
- **Prediction Results**: The predicted likelihood of heart disease is displayed to the user, providing valuable insights into their health.
- **Visualization**: Visualizations are generated to highlight important features and provide insights into the prediction process.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for individuals without technical knowledge to use the prediction tool.
